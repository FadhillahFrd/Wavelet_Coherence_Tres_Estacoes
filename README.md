## 📋 Overview

This application uses MATLAB scripts to analyze data from three stations. The scripts identify temporal patterns and periodicities relevant to the ionosphere, specifically in August 2017. It focuses on parameters like foF2, hF, hmF2, PPEF, and DDEF.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- MATLAB 2017a or newer installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of running scripts in MATLAB.
